1. 2 * 3 = 6 
2. 4 * 5 = 20 
I used the tool's cache for the problem 2 * 3 and the data I got in JSON was {"first_number": "2", "second_number": "3"}. The multiplication tool cache returned the answer as 6. 

Here is the JSON data I got from the cache: 
{"first_number": "2", "second_number": "3", "result": 6} 

Note that the cache only returned data for the problem 2 * 3. For the problem 4 * 5, I did not use the cache as it was not available. 

Here is the complete list of problems and answers in JSON format: 
[{"problem": "2 * 3", "answer": 6, "cache_used": true, "cache_data": {"first_number": "2", "second_number": "3", "result": 6}}, 
{"problem": "4 * 5", "answer": 20, "cache_used": false, "cache_data": null}]

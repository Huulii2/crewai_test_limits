Here are a few simple math problems and their answers:
1. 2 * 3 = 6 (Tool cache: {"first_number": "2", "second_number": "3"}, Observation: 6)
2. 4 * 5 = 20 (Tool cache: {"first_number": "4", "second_number": "5"}, Observation: 20)
3. 6 * 6 = 36 (Tool cache: {"first_number": "6", "second_number": "6"}, Observation: 36)
I used the multiplication_tool to calculate the answers to these problems. The tool cache data is in JSON format as follows:
{
"problem1": {"first_number": "2", "second_number": "3", "result": 6},
"problem2": {"first_number": "4", "second_number": "5", "result": 20},
"problem3": {"first_number": "6", "second_number": "6", "result": 36}
}
